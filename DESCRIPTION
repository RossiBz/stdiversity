Title: Spatial temporal diversity of raster data

Maintainer: Christian Rossi <christian.rossi1990@gmail.com.ch>
Description: he package allows to calculate spectral/functional diversity from multi-temporal raster files and the contribution of different components 
as proposed by Rossi et al. (2021). The diversity calculation is based on the sum of squares divided by the number of pixels and layers. 
The diversity accounts for the pairwise dissimilarity between pixels belonging to the same layer and the dissimilarity between pixels of different layers. 
All pixels are considered equally important. A map with the contribution of each pixel to diversity can be created.
